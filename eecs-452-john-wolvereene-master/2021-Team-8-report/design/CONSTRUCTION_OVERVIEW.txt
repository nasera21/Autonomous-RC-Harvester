Below are instructions for the basic design of the RC Car. All instructions refer to pictures included in the design folder.
Parts list is found in the Team_8_Parts_List.xlsx file.

Preparing the Purchased RC Car:
	
	Original controller is to be removed (OG_Controller.jpg), original servo is to be removed.
	The original servo is a 5-wire servo that requires a separate driving controller to operate, thus we need
	to remove this servo and replace it with a 3 wire servo for easy use. But we will keep the original steering
	linkage system. The original controller also must be removed as it is not suitable for our needs.

	For the battery, remove the original battery connectors, strip wires, and crimp on spade connectors. Then cut a DC
	barrel jack cable, strip the internal wires, and crimp opposite sex spade connectors. Connect the DC barrel jack cable
	to the battery via the spade connectors. The motor and Arduino power source has been prepared. Similar to (Battery.jpg)

	For the motor, cut the original connectors and strip wires. These do not need connectors on them as they will be inserted
	into the Screw-hole terminal on the Adafruit Motor Shield in port M4. Similar to (Underbody_side.jpg)

	The servo prep is complicated. The basic idea is to feed a screw through the linkage bar into the servo drum as shown in
	the picture (Servo_linkage.jpg). First finding a mating screw that fits the servo is necessary. One may need to use a standoff 
	as well if the screw length is inadequate. For both cars used in this project, a small standoff was inserted into the servo drum
	and then the screw was fed in through the other side of the linkage bar. The next step is to feed the screw through the linkage bar
	and screw into the servo drum until tight. You may need to expand the size of the holes on either side of the linkage bar by shaving
	it. Once tight, set the servo to 90 degrees. At this point you will need to ensure that when the servo is commanded at 90 degrees, the
	wheels are aligned such that the car will move straight. Position the servo on the plastic drive shaft protector such that the 90 degree
	angle forces the wheels to be aligned straight. Once positioned, hot glue servo to the plastic drive shaft protector.

	To mount the Arduino, we hot glued pieces of cardboard into a stack such that the arduino could lay flat on the plastic drive shaft
	protector and not impact the motor. Then the Arduino is taped to the cardboard stack. The Adafruit Motor Shield is then sandwiched
	on top of the Arduino as it was designed to be. To power Arduino, the motor, and servo plug in the dc barrel jack cable connected to
	the battery and place battery into the shelf where the battery was originally placed in the RC Car. Similar to (Underbody_OtherSide.jpg)

	To mount the Raspberry Pi, and Raspberry Pi camera, certain modifications to the plastic body the RC car came with need to be made.
	Follow the cuts made in these pictures (Plastic_body.jpg) (Plastic_body_back.jpg). The idea is to expose the Arduino to prevent any collisions
	between the plastic body and the Arduino. A small incision needs to be made on the windshield of the plastic body for cables to be ran
	through from the distance sensors. The team used a piece of cardboard, hot glued to the back of the car to mount the Raspberry Pi Camera.
	After the plastic body is prepared, mount on vehicle and make any necessary adjustments to get it to rest on the underbody easy. Then tape
	the Raspberry Pi to the bed of the truck, tape the distance sensors and route all cables as necessary as shown in this picture. (Completed_Car.png)



AT THIS POINT YOU SHOULD HAVE A MODIFIED RC CAR READY FOR SOFTWARE EXECUTION. ENJOY!
