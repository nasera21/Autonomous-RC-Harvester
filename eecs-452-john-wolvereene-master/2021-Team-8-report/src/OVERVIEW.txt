CONTENTS
	Arduino_Code 					- Contains all code for the Arduino
		Arduino_Custom_Libraries		- Contains Custom Libraries made for the Arduino Code
			Distance_Sensor_Library		- Library for the Distance Sensor
			RC_Car_Library			- Library for the RC Car
			UART_Library			- Library for the UART bus
		Arduino_Main				- Contains .ino file for the Arduino (main file)
	Raspberry_Pi_Code				- Contains all code for the Raspberry Pi
		finalCVClean.py				- "Main" python file for Raspberry Pi
		UART_Quantization.py			- UART quantization function library
		UART_rpiSerial.py			- UART bus library


The Arduino code files are meant to be all uploaded to the Arduino Uno. The folders for the
Distance Sensors, RC Car, and UART bus in the Arduino_Custom_Libraries folder are meant to be
libraries installed on the Arduino IDE prior to uploading the main file. Within the
Arduino_Main file, there is a single .ino file meant to be uploaded to the Arduino Uno and
calls the functions in the custom library.


The Raspberry Pi code files are all contained in the Raspberry_Pi_Code folder. finalCVClean.py
is meant to be the "main" file, and when run using the command "python3 finalCVClean.py" executes
the entire program. UART_Quantization.py and UART_rpiSerial.py provides the needed UART funtions
for finalCVClean.py to call from.

The execution of all of this code relies on proper setup of the RC Car, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi
hardware!
