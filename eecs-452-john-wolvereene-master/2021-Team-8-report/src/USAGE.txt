USAGE

	The goal of the execution for this project's code is to be hands-off as possible.
	This means that there is very little human interaction necessary once the code begins
	execution. However, the user can do some calibration to calibrate the computer vision
	parameters. On startup of the program, several windows pop up showing the different 
	isolated values such as H-values image, S-values image, raw image, etc as well as a
	slidebar that allows the user to fine tune the parameters such that the red stakes are
	well located in the current lighting conditions. One can use the slide bar to adjust the
	threshold values until all threshold values lead to most of the stakes being identified.
	At this point, the user can then input those constants to the global values near the top
	of finalCVClean.py. To capture the current image and display a plot of detected stakes, 
	press c while the program is running. To exit the program, press q while the program is 
	running. Of course to exit the program, a standard CTRL+C can be used to end the
	program.
